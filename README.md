The game was inspired by the google chrome dinosaur run game where you have to avoid obstacles as they move towards you
on the ground and in the air (and Ben A. thought it reminded him of a certain character hence the star screen background).
In our version you play as a blue block and are trying to dodge the red blocks for as long as you can. You get points
as long as you stay alive and for every block you dodge, however the more points you get the faster the red blocks come
at you, and the more points you'll get for dodging a block. You start with three lives (shown by the red bar in the top left)
and lose one ever time you are hit, however there is the chance to get two extra lives: one at 30,000 points and the
next at 77,777 points.

Controls:
mouse: used to click start and restart buttons.

up-arrow-key: tap to jump if on the ground, double jumps ONCE if player is in the air. Stand up if crouched (this happens
no matter what even if you are out of jumps).

left-arrow-key: tap to inch left, hold to move slowly on the ground, spam to move rapidly in the air or on the ground

right-arrow-key: tap to inch right, hold to move slowly on the ground, spam to move rapidly in the air or on the ground

down-arrow-key: tap to enter crouch (you don't need to hold it), while crouched you can fit under certain obstacles on
the ground, also you fall three times as fast when crouching in the air(necessary for higher speeds).
