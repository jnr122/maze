The game can be run by cloning the repository and running Game.cpp

A 2d platformer game where the player explores scenes looking for coins and avoiding enemies. When the player collects
three coins, they advance to the next level. There are five levels total, so beating the game means
collecting 15 coins. 

The player can move side to side or jump, and is controlled by the arrow keys. (m) toggles the map which fills out as the
player moves through the scenes, and (h) toggles the health bar and coin count. The start, restart, and continue buttons
respond to mouse clicks.
